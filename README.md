[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/apphubdeploy.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/apphubdeploy)

**Build and Deploy to [AppHub.io][1] in one fell swoop.**

![Screencast](readme_assets/apphubdeploy_screencast.gif)


## Installation

```bash
npm install --global apphubdeploy
```

This will install AppHubDeploy globally so you can use it in all of your AppHub projects without installing it for each one.


## Usage

_Run from your project root directory._

This will build and deploy to AppHub.io with the default settings:

```bash
$ apphubdeploy

```

**Build and Deploy with Options**

The real power of AppHub Deploy comes when you add options such as `-t` / `--target` allowing you to deliver over-the-air (OTA) updates to your users via AppHub.io without ever leaving the command line. **Powerful stuff!**

For example, this will create and deploy a build with a **name** and **description** that's targeted to your **debug** users who are running **version 1.0.3** of your app:

```bash
$ apphubdeploy -n "Build Name" -d "Build Description" -t "debug" -a 1.0.3
```

Less time clicking and more time being awesome.


#### AppHub Credentials

The first time you call `apphubdeploy` in a project directory it will prompt you for your **AppHub ID** and **AppHub Secret**, which can be found on the settings panel of your [AppHub.io][1] account.

Your AppHub credentials will be stored in a `.apphub` file that is readable only by you for security. Going forward, it will try to read your AppHub credentials from this file instead of prompting you.

In the event that you need to change your AppHub credentials, either modify the `.apphub` file itself or simply run `apphubdeploy` with the `--configure` option, like `apphubdeploy --configure`, and you will be prompted for your credentials again.

##### .apphub File

In the event that you're creating the `.apphub` file yourself, for example with an integration server, here is the sample format for the file: 

```json
{"appHubId":"thisismywonderfulapphubid","appHubSecret":"andthisismywonderfulapphubsecretshhhhh"}
```

## Options

You can pass a number of options to the `apphubdeploy` command in order to specify how the build will be treated by AppHub as well as other options for the CLI like `--verbose`.

You can get a list of all the options by passing `-h` or `--help` as an option:

```bash
$ apphubdeploy --help
```
